# SKOS-XL Archetype

The SKOS archetype is for databases that will contain [SKOS-XL](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/skos-xl.html). SKOS-XL defines an extension for the Simple Knowledge Organization System, providing additional support for describing and linking lexical entities. This will also include the SKOS schema and SKOS constraints expressed in SHACL.

* The schema and constraints in this archetype are [inline](https://www.stardog.com/docs/#_inline_archetypes) 
so they will be loaded into the database and will be available for SPARQL queries.
